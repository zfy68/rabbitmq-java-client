      These settings require careful tuning. Depending on them we get
      one of three outcomes:
      1) this program terminates normally
      2) the broker runs out of memory and eventually dies, and the
      this program barfs and/or dies
      3) there are lots of timeout errors in the broker log

      It's the last case we are interested in.
